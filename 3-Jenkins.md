## What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is a open-source automation tool written in __JAVA__ that facilitates __continious integration__ in software development. It automates the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, allowing developers to focus on writing code and improving their applications.

## Why Jenkins
Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously make it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and make it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It provides many plugins that help to support building, deploying and automating any project.

## Key Features of Jenkins
__1. Continious Integration and Continious Delivery (DI/CD):__ Jenkins automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day (CI). It also automates the delivery of code changes to production environments (CD). <br>
__2. Extensible With Plugins:__ Jenkins has a rich ecosystem of plugins that allow it to integrate with various tools and platforms, such as Git, Maven, Gradle, Docker, Kubernetes, and more. Plugins extend Jenkinsâ€™ capabilities and enable custom workflows. <br>
__3. Distributed Builds:__ Jenkins supports the distribution of build and test workloads across multiple machines, which helps in improving performance and reliability. <br>
__4. Pipeline as Code:__ Jenkins uses a feature called Jenkins Pipeline, which allows developers to define their build, test, and deployment processes as code. This is usually done using a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Groovy. <br>
__5. Extensive Customization:__ Jenkins allows for extensive customization through its flexible configuration options and its support for scripting and custom plugins. <br>

## How Jenkins Works
__1. Source Code Integration:__ Jenkins integrates with source control systems (Git) to pull code changes. <br>
__2. Build Automation:__ Jenkins triggers build processes using tools like Maven, Gradle, or Ant. The build scripts compile the code, resolve dependencies, and package the application. <br>
__3. Testing:__ Jenkins runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure the code changes do not break existing functionality. It can use testing frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, or others. <br>
__4. Deployment:__ After successful builds and tests, Jenkins can deploy the application to different environments (development, staging, production) using deployment tools and services. <br>
__5. Notification and Reporting:__ Jenkins provides detailed logs and reports for each build and test. It can notify developers of build results via email, Slack, or other communication tools. <br>

## Benefits of Using Jenkins
__1. Increased Developer Productivity:__ <br>
__2. Scalability:__ <br>
__3. Flexibility:__ The wide range of plugins and customization options makes jenkins adaptable to various workflows and development environments. <br>
__4. Handles errors:__ Continious integration ensures that code changes are tested frequently, allowing to gracefully handle failures and errors, and resume or retry failed tasks. <br>
__3. Faster Release Cycles:__
